- Some resources are found in external files, e.g., EGAdict in c3dedict.obj
(assuming GRHEADERLINKED is defined and GRMODE == EGAGR).

- Currently it looks like id_ca.c:EGAdict is a 8-bit unsigned int (a byte)
from another place, but its ADDRESS actually casted to a huffnode ptr in the
case above. Guess the value isn't important, but it should've still been
declared as *some* variable.

- Support file opening with O_TEXT (otherwise O_BINARY is always used)?
Used in (id_ca.c) debughandle, profilehandle
and (id_us.c) in case HELPTEXTLINKED is *not* defined, textual files.

* At first, we may need to define HELPTEXTLINKED (for different reasons).
* O_TEXT and O_BINARY aren't recognized on Unix, because newlines are LFs.
