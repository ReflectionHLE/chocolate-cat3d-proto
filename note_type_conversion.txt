What do we want to replace...

*** Boolean:

boolean -> id0_boolean_t

*** Chars / 8-bit ints:

signed char -> id0_signed_char_t
unsigned char -> id0_unsigned_char_t

THEN

Same but with tabs

THEN

char -> id0_char_t

THEN

byte -> id0_byte_t (even though it's just an unsigned char in original code by definition...)

*** 16-bit ints:

NOT FOR NOW (see why soon)

*** 32-bit ints:

(signed/unsigned) long int -> Never mentioned

THEN

signed long -> id0_signed_long_t
unsigned long -> id0_unsigned_long_t

THEN

Same but with tabs

THEN

long -> id0_long_t

THEN

longword -> id0_longword_t (even though it's just unsigned long by definition...)

*** 16-bit ints:

short -> id0_short_t (mentioned just once)
unsigned int -> Never mentinoed (only once in the "word" typedef in ID_HEADS.H)
signed int -> Never mentioned
word -> id0_word_t (same as unsigned int in the original code)

THEN

int -> id0_int_t
unsigned -> id0_unsigned_t

*** floats??? (c3_draw.c)

See c3_draw.c - What should we do here???

*** doubles??? (c3_draw.c)

*** Replacements of MAXINT and MININT??? (c3_draw.c)
